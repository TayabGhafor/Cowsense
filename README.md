## 🧠 AI Model Details

- 📸 Model Type: YOLOv8m Object Detection
- 🏷️ Annotated with: **Roboflow**
- 📍 Trained on: Google Colab (Python, Ultralytics)
- 🚀 Deployment: Hugging Face Space + Roboflow Space
- 🧪 Output: Annotated images, confidence score, disease label

#### 🔍 Model Capabilities:
- Detect visible diseases on cattle skin/body
- Annotate affected areas
- Generate report with disease name + accuracy

> 📚 The model is trained to **self-improve** by saving feedback & future annotations.

## 📡 IoT Device - CowLink

🐄 **CowLink** is a custom-built smart collar worn by cattle. It collects vital health data and sends it to our backend server in real time.

![CowLink Device](images/COWLINK.png)

### 🧰 Sensor Suite
- **ESP32** (Microcontroller)
- **DS18B20** – Body Temperature 🌡️
- **DHT22** – Environment Temp & Humidity 🌦️
- **MAX30102** – Heart Rate & SpO2 ❤️
- **MPU6050** – Motion, Rest & Activity 📈
- **GPS Module** – Real-time Location 🗺️

📤 Sensor data is transmitted to a **Node.js/Express.js server** hosted on **Render**, then shown in the farmer app.

🔔 Abnormal readings generate **instant alerts** to the farmer.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cowsense.git
   cd cowsense

2. **Navigate to the backend and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Flutter dependencies for both apps**

   ```bash
   # Farmer App
   cd ../farmer-app
   flutter pub get

   # Vet App
   cd ../vet-app
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Create environment file for backend**
   Inside the `backend` folder, create a `.env` file and add the following:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
   RENDER_API=https://your_render_server_url
   ```

5. **Run the backend server**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Run the apps**

   ```bash
   # Farmer App
   cd ../farmer-app
   flutter run

   # Vet App
   cd ../vet-app
   flutter run
   ```
